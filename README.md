## Project Overview

This project showcases building a multi-tab SwiftUI app focused on cryptocurrency portfolio management, designed with modular components and reactive state management. It highlights:

- **Crypto Portfolio Tab:** Displays the user’s total portfolio value with toggle between fiat (₹) and crypto (₿), a smooth Catmull-Rom spline line chart visualizing trends, quick asset cards for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a list of recent transactions.
- **Exchange Tab:** Modal interface for exchanging cryptocurrencies, allowing ETH and INR input amounts, swap functionality, detailed rate/spread/gas fee information, and an exchange button.
- **Record Tab:** Scrollable list of recent user activity records with icons, titles, and dates presented in a clean card style.
- **Wallet Tab:** Placeholder screen with navigation setup, ready for future wallet management features.

The app is designed exclusively for **dark mode** with careful use of colors, gradients, and shadows to enhance depth and readability.
